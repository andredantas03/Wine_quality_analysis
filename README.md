# Wine_quality_analysis
A data science analysis on the Wine Quality dataset

The dataset models wine quality based on physicochemical properties (inputs) and sensory data (output). The primary problem is to understand and predict wine quality, scored between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent), using the dataset. The two datasets are related to red and white Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine variants. For more details, consult: http://www.vinhoverde.pt/en/ or the reference [Cortez et al., 2009].  Due to privacy and logistic issues, only physicochemical (inputs) and sensory (the output) variables are available (e.g. there is no data about grape types, wine brands, wine selling prices, etc.).

- Question to Answer:
How can the physicochemical properties of wine be used to predict its quality, and which factors are the most influential?
